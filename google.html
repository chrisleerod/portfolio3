            <p>Getting questions answered related to classes, majors, guidance, advice, and other like-minded topics
                should not be a difficult process. This can be solved by promoting community-oriented interactions
                between students.

                <br>
                This design exercise is my take on the problem mentioned above. It was completed over a seven-day design
                sprint in response to Google’s UX internship design challenge.

            <h1>Background info</h1>
            <p>I applied to Google’s 2020 UX summer internship and was instructed to choose between two exercises to
                design a solution for. I was given a seven-day deadline to research, wireframe, and design my product.

        <div class="the-challenge">
            <h1>The challenge</h1>
            <p>“Your school wants to strengthen the community by encouraging experienced students to connect with new
                students and help them adjust to campus life. Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees to
                discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how someone may become a
                mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.”</p>

        <div class="defining-the-sprint">
            <h1>Defining the sprint</h1>
            <p>After understanding the prompt and deadline, I decided to use Google Venture’s design sprint methodology
                to stay on top of the short deadline and have pre-determined goals. I used it as a general guideline and
                tweaked it according to my needs and limitations.</p>

            <h1>01 Understand</h1>
            <p>This phase was very important. It would lay out the ground work for the entire project. In order to
                understand the problem thoroughly, I asked some critical questions.</p>

            <img class="icon" src="icons/profile-user.svg" alt="">
            <p>How might we allow students to connect and discover other students and mentors, become mentors, and
                satisfy the needs of both mentors and mentees with MentorU? </p>

        <div class="guidance-paragraph">
            <img class="icon" src="icons/compass-object.svg" alt="">
            <p>How do current first-year students seek guidance? How do they connect with other students? How do they
                discover new opportunities?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="understand">
            <p>After forming a couple preliminary questions, I interviewed students and conducted a survey to collect
                both quantitative and qualitative data. This allowed me to generate user insights, personas, and better
                empathize with fellow students.</p>
