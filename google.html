                <p>I applied to Google’s 2020 UX summer internship and was instructed to choose between two exercises to
                    design a solution for. I was given a seven-day deadline to research, wireframe, and design my
                    product.

                    new
                    students and help them adjust to campus life. Design an experience that allows mentors and mentees
                    to
                    discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how someone may
                    become a
                    mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.”</p>

                    the
                    problem. I wanted to create an application that was a place of familiarity. My university is apart
                    of
                    the G Suite system, so integrating things such as Google Calendar was important to create a sense of
                    familiarity.</p>

                <h1>Using personas to identify pain points</h1>
                <p>Once there was a clear hierarchy of the problems at hand, I began creating personas to give myself a
                    clearer view of who I was designing this application for. I wanted to keep in mind that there were
                    students at different levels of experience, and some new students aren’t freshman. They can also be
                    transfer students. So moving forward, I created three personas: The Freshman, The Transfer Student,
                    and
                    The Experienced Senior.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="experienced-students">
                <h1>Considering the experienced students</h1>
                <p>One group of students that would help the process of helping new students would be experienced
                    students.
                    How would they become mentors? I wanted to create a process that offered both reward and opportunity
                    for
                    good students; however, I did not want to make it exclusive. I considered a GPA threshold of 3.0
                    would
                    grant experienced students access to become a mentor automatically. If a student did not meet these
                    requirements, he or she could apply on campus and be interviewed.</p>

                <p>After analyzing the initial sketches, I began to draw some questions to either validate or invalidate
                    my
                    design decisions. This would allow me to refine and decide what worked and didn’t work. This phase
                    allowed me to reveal some holes in my designs that I needed to address. Some of these holes included
                    notifications and ways to review and respond to connection requests. I also used this time to
                    reevaluate
                    the navigation system I had in place.</p>

                    it
                    allowed me to get a grasp of what the overall direction and mission of this application was going to
                    be.
                    What screens could I consolidate into one? Which interfaces could be adjusted to remove unnecessary
                    information? I was able to view the experience as a map instead of a linear timeline. My ideation
                    was
                    dramatically shifted thanks to these small roadblocks and changes.</p>

                <p>After finalizing the wireframe and sketches, I then moved onto low-fidelity prototyping while using
                    Material UI as a framework. This expedited the design process which allowed for more thoughtful
                    decisions. I created a user flow diagram prior to completing the prototype via InVision Studio.</p>

                <h1>Conducting user testing</h1>
                <p>After designing and creating a functional prototype in InvisionApp, I conducted some user tests with
                    three users. No context of the design was given prior to testing. The goal was to hear from unbiased
                    users and how they felt about the functionality and experience as a whole.</p>
