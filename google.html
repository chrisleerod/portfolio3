                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>I applied to Google‚Äôs 2020 UX summer internship and was instructed to choose between two
                        exercises to
                        design a solution for. I was given a seven-day deadline to research, wireframe, and design my

                        with
                        new
                        students and help them adjust to campus life. Design an experience that allows mentors and
                        mentees
                        to
                        discover each other. Consider the needs of both mentors and mentees, including how someone may
                        become a
                        mentor and how to connect mentors to mentees.‚Äù</p>

                    <h1>Using personas to identify pain points</h1>
                    <p>Once there was a clear hierarchy of the problems at hand, I began creating personas to give
                        myself a
                        clearer view of who I was designing this application for. I wanted to keep in mind that there
                        were
                        students at different levels of experience, and some new students aren‚Äôt freshman. They can also
                        be
                        transfer students. So moving forward, I created three personas: The Freshman, The Transfer
                        Student,
                        and
                        The Experienced Senior.</p>

                        students.
                        How would they become mentors? I wanted to create a process that offered both reward and

                        for
                        good students; however, I did not want to make it exclusive. I considered a GPA threshold of 3.0
                        would
                        grant experienced students access to become a mentor automatically. If a student did not meet

                        notifications and ways to review and respond to connection requests. I also used this time to

                        it
                        allowed me to get a grasp of what the overall direction and mission of this application was

                        be.
                        What screens could I consolidate into one? Which interfaces could be adjusted to remove
                        unnecessary
                        information? I was able to view the experience as a map instead of a linear timeline. My
                        ideation
                        was
                        dramatically shifted thanks to these small roadblocks and changes.</p>

                        decisions. I created a user flow diagram prior to completing the prototype via InVision Studio.
